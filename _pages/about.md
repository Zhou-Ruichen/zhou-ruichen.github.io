======
My name is Ruichen Zhou, and I’m currently a PhD student at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, specializing in altimetry satellite data processing and the application of deep learning in satellite Earth observation.

This website serves as a digital portfolio showcasing my academic work, publications, and related projects. Here, you’ll find my CV, an overview of my research, and a collection of personal notes that provide a comprehensive snapshot of my academic and professional journey.

But now you may only be able to see my personal information, CV, etc., because this website has just started to "renovate", which proves that I can't wait to contact you and consult with you about visiting.
