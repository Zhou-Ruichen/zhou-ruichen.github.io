excerpt: 'SDUST2023VGGA is a global oceanic vertical gradient of gravity anomaly (VGGA) model on a 1 arcmin ×1 arcmin grid, constructed using multi-directional mean sea surface (MSS) data from the DTU21MSS. Covering latitudes from 80°S to 80°N, this model incorporates multi-directional observations to better capture variations in the oceanic gravity field. Comparison with the SIO V32.1 model indicates a high level of consistency, supporting SDUST2023VGGA’s suitability for studies of seafloor structure, ocean geophysics, and mass distribution.'
