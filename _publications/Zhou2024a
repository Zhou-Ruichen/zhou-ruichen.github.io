excerpt: 'Advancements in satellite altimetry have refined MSS models, facilitating high-res VGAG model computation. Focusing on the Arabian Sea, this study used SDUST2020 MSS, DTU22 & CNES-CLS22 MDT models, and XGM2019e_2159 for remove-restore. It calculated geoid second-order derivatives in multiple directions, determined gradient components, and restored long-wavelength data to build a VGAG model. Results, validated against SIO V32.1, show effective marine gravity field extraction and uncertainty mitigation'
