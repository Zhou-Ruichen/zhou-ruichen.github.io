excerpt: 'High-precision and high-resolution satellite altimetry data from CryoSat-2 are widely utilized for marine gravity inversion. The vertical gravity gradient is a crucial parameter of the Earth's gravity field. To evaluate the performance of vertical gravity gradient determined from CryoSat-2 altimeter data, relevant processing and calculations are carried out, and finally comparison shows high accuracy and precision of it.'
