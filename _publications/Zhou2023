excerpt: "CryoSat-2 data are used for marine gravity inversion. Focusing on the Arabian Sea, SSHs are error-corrected and processed to obtain geoid and residual gradients. Using LSC and finite-difference methods, a 1 arcmin ×1 arcmin gravity anomaly gradient model is developed. Compared with the SIO V32.1 model, the RMS difference of 7.69E shows the high accuracy of CryoSat-2-derived vertical gravity gradient."
